# credit-card-approval
overview:
With the increasing number of credit card applications, banks are opting towards the use
of prediction-based algorithms as opposed to manual approval methods. Data analysis has
exhibited a strong correlation between several financial and personal factors of a client and
the likelihood of said client complying with their respective bank's credit policies. In this
paper, we propose the use of the Machine Learning algorithm to predict and grant credit
cards to applicants based on the customers' activity history. We used some financial and
personal factors. We predicted the resulting factors through the use of Machine Learning
algorithm with an emphasis on error minimization. Using this Machine Learning model, the
machine-learned which of these applicants are most likely to accumulate bad debts and
granted or rejected the applications based on the prediction.
